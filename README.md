# Turborepo Elysia

This is an official starter Turborepo.

## Using this example

Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

-   `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
-   `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
-   `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
-   `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
-   `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
-   [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```sh
cd elysia-mono
bun i
bun run dev
```

### Test

To run tests for all apps and packages, run the following command:

```sh
bun i
bunx playwright install --with-deps
bun run build
bun run test
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```

### Repo Uses Semantic Commit Messages

See how a minor change to your commit message style can make you a better programmer.

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

`<scope>` is optional

## Example

```
feat: add hat wobble
^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> Summary in present tense.
|
+-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.
```

More Examples:

-   `feat`: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
-   `fix`: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
-   `docs`: (changes to the documentation)
-   `style`: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
-   `refactor`: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
-   `test`: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
-   `chore`: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
